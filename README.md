Picochlorum renovo metabolic model

Picochlorum renovo is a high-productivity green microalga that can thrive under diverse environmental conditions, including high salinity, light/dark cycling, and nutrient stress. Here, we developed the first genome-scale metabolic model for P. renovo (iPicre1230) to elucidate the metabolic strategies underlying its resilience and biotechnological potential. This model was constructed using a semi-automated, template-based approach followed by extensive manual curation, with a particular focus on lipid metabolism, which accounts for 63% of reactions. iPicre1230 contains 4,642 reactions, 3,610 metabolites, and 1,230 genes in 10 compartments. Validation using carbon substrate utilization experiments showed high quantitative predictive performance (R² = 0.79), also highlighting P. renovo’s metabolic versatility under light and dark conditions. We integrated transcriptomic data from zinc supplementation and salinity stress conditions to generate context-specific models that revealed distinct adaptive responses. Under optimal conditions (0.1 µM zinc), P. renovo exhibited enhanced growth and chlorophyll accumulation, driven by upregulated mitochondrial respiration and photosynthetic activity. In contrast, salinity stress triggered a broad transcriptional response with minimal impact on growth, suggesting fine-tuned regulatory mechanisms that prioritize homeostasis. Model simulations indicated selective activation of protective reactions such as ppGpp-mediated nucleotide recycling. Altogether, the study provides a mechanistic understanding of P. renovo’s robust growth under fluctuating environmental conditions and offers a foundational tool for metabolic engineering of this biotechnologically relevant alga.
